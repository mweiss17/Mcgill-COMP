<td>Oreo is a strong and opinionated male cat. If you<br> 
are a lover of black and white cats, then Oreo is<br>
for you! He gets along well with children, and<br>
loves playing in a yard. He is already neutered,<br>
so letting him go outside is great! This cat is<br>
best paired with a rural owner<br>
<br>
<input type="checkbox" name = "oreo"><Font color="#FF0066">Take Oreo home today!</Font></td>

<td>Skittles is a little pudge-cat. We, employees of<br>
the Kitty Store, are sure she will grow up into a <br>
great housecat. She is very afraid of loud noises<br>
and mice. Her favorite things are tuna popsicles<br>
and lying on the couch. She hates long walks on<br>
the beach. She has all her shots and vaccines, <br>
and is ready to be cuddled today!<br>
<br>
<input type="checkbox" name="skittles"><Font color="#FF0066">Take Skittles home today!</Font></td>

<td>Cream is another male cat. He is very playful<br>
and his favorite thing is yarn. If you knit, this cat<br>
is not for you. He will destroy your knitted hat, <br>
gloves, and sweaters. Fear him. He makes up for<br>
this trait with an innocent look and through his<br>
ever surprising nature. He is a born climber,<br>
mouser, and acrobat.<br>

<td>Your new kitten's first 12 months of life<br>
are important to his or her development! We know<br>
you want a strong kitteh, and this Iams Kitten<br>
food delivers the nutrition to keep her growing <br>
strong and silky. We promise that your kitteh will<br>
build strong muscles, especially if you also buy<br>
the Cat Harness and exerise her!</td>

<td>This cat harness is completely adjustable.<br>
Your cat will be protected from injury due to <br>
neck strain, and be comfortable to move freely<br>
without tangling herself up in her leash.<br>
If you want to keep your cat healthy, make<br>
sure that you have a few months free to train<br>
your cat. It is a real investment, but to unleash<br>
the raw, hunter cat from your apartment cat<br>
will make both you and your cat very happy</td>

<td>The Cat Rat Fishing Toy is a mouse on a rope<br>
with a pole. Whether you are a lazy or<br>
enthusiastic cat owner, this toy is for you and<br>
your cat. Playing with your cat not only bonds<br>
you and your cat, but trains your cat to murder.<br>
Like he is supposed to.</td>
